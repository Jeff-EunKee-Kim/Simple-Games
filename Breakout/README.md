- Bugs or Concerns: Website is not designed responsively. It has an optimum layout for a 15.6" full screen. 

- Extra Credit Features: There are many extra features I added to this game. First of all, it has an easy and hard mode that differ in the ball speed. Also, it has cheat codes that enables the player to easily win the game. To win right away, win game button will do it. To see the process of winning the game, the player could set the paddle into max width and speed up the ball and win game. It tracks the player's remaining life and score they achieved as he/she play the game. Finally, I added rainbow colors to the bricks and an intriguing background music that evokes childhood memories. There are more description of the game on the website.
