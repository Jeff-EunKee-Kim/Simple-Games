- Bugs or Concerns: This assignment was one of the most interesting assignments I had this semester. I liked the freedom we had in choosing the library we wanted to explore more on. I enjoyed doing the breakout assignment we had earlier this semester and decided to do another assignment on creating a game. Using P5, creating a game was incredibly easier on javascript as it had a lot of built in functions for drawing and functions that were useful in making a game. I've also added the p5.sound library to implement background music into my game. The p5.js loads on a chrome web browser, so it works fine without websites like Heroku as long as it is opened on an online chrome browser. 

- Features: I created a game of flappy bird on p5.js and added multiple features such as the score and background music. The player will gain a point every time it successfully passes through the walls without hitting them. There is also a cute Sun on the top left corner that improves the aesthetic view of the game. The walls and the ball were all drawn using the p5 library, which made it incredibly easy to draw.
